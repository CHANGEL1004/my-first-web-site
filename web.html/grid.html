  <div>AMedia Queries is an enhancement of the @media rules of CSS and the “media”
     attribute in HTML. It adds parameters such as size of display,
     color depth and aspect ratio. This is because within a class of media
     (such as TV sets) there can still be important variations.
     It is related to the work on CC/PP, but is a much more
     light-weight and limited solution</div>
